# Configure Webhooks

Your Lagoobernetes administrator will also give you the route to the webhook-handler. You will add this to your repository as an outgoing webhook, and choose which events to send to Lagoobernetes. Typically, you will send all push and pull request events. In Lagoobernetes it is possible to add a regular expression to determine which branches and pull requests actually result in a deploy, and your Lagoobernetes administrator can set that up for you. For example, all branches that start with `feature-` could be deployed to Lagoobernetes.
